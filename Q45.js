// Q45: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    const car = { manufacturer, model };
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => {

}
const myCar = createCar('Honda', 'Civic', ['color', 'white'], ['year', '2022']);
